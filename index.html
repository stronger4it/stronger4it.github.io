Let me first make this clear: you can't just lose weight. You need to find a way of living / eating that you can sustain. If you are marking out a temporary phase, then that's okay. But, I want you to make an additional, longer-term plan so that you have a direction to go to after this phase. The harder you crash-diet, the more you'll be tempted to to stuff your face when the diet is over. If you have a plan for what to do after this phase, you can better resist the temptations. Going for a 2000 calorie diet is highly ambitious, and I know you must be starving, so I know how hard it's going to be to resist your temptations. Your body will fight back to get where it is now after you lose weight because you're putting it through a shock and it's used to doing what you've been doing. I just want you to be ready for that fight.

To answer your question about not eating enough fat, let me first explain a few basics of nutrition.
Nutrients can be broken into macro and micro nutrients.

Let's focus on macronutrients first: Protein, Fats, Carbohydrates, and Alcohol.
70% of your daily calories is NOT 70% of your daily food intake.
1 gram of Protein = 4 Calories, 1 gram Carbs = 4 Cal
1 gram Fats = 9 Cal, 1 g Alcohol = 7 Cal
So, for fat to be 70% of your 2000 Calories, you should consume (2000 Calories)*(70 Cal fat / 100 Cal)*(1 g fat / 9 Cal fat) ~= 160 grams of fat.
Another thing to think about is density. 160 grams of fat is going to be much smaller (denser) than 160 grams of carbohydrates. So, you will have less volume of food in your stomach even if you eat the same mass of food.

Let's talk about feeling full. Your body can tell you to eat in multiple ways.
Your stomach has sensors for density of food and for amount of food.
Normally, you listen to the ones telling you how much food is in your stomach, but if you listen carefully, sometimes you can feel satiated without feeling full of food.
When you eat fatty foods and get rid of carb-rich foods, you're eating denser foods. You can feel satiated without feeling full of food that way.
BUT, I know I feel much better when I also feel full. To do this, I eat low-carb vegetables. Spinach is a great example. I get my calories from my protein and fat, but then get the extra satisfaction of feeling full by eating a lot of vegetables.

Gluconeogenesis
200 - 300g of protein for you -- ## Calories
That leaves ## Calories for Carbs and Alcohol.
If you want to stay in Ketosis, you should ...



Breaking macronutrients down further:
Saturated vs. Unsaturated fats
Omega 3s vs. Omega 6s and inflammation
Don't add extra fats. Just don't remove them. So, eat the fatty chicken skin. Don't cut the fat off your beef. Eat the egg yolks, .... Eggs are great!!
Most extra fats have soybean oil -- not good.
Olive oil vs. olives -- feel more full when you eat the whole olive. etc.

Greek yogurt instead of milk -- less carbs
Whole fat greek yogurt instead of skim -- more fat
ETC -- Choose the options that keep fat in them. Don't remove fat. That way, you don't have to add unnatural fats.

MCT
CLA -- Feel less hungry
